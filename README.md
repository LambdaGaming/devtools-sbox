(WIP) This is an addon for s&box that contains a collection of tools meant to be used in developement of addons for the Sandbox game, or other games that derive from Sandbox. Based off my [developement tool collection for Gmod.](https://github.com/LambdaGaming/devtools) The initial plan is to make everything that is currently included in the Gmod version, then add whatever else I feel is necessary afterwards. Suggestions are also welcome!

# Tool List
- Get color of trace entity.
- Get vector and eye angles of local player.
