This is an addon for s&box that contains a collection of tools meant to be used in developement of addons for the Sandbox game, or other games that derive from Sandbox. Based off my [developement tool collection for Gmod.](https://github.com/LambdaGaming/devtools) Right now it includes all of the tools from the Gmod version, but suggestions for more are welcome!

# Tool List
- Get color of trace entity.
- Get network ID and hammer ID of trace entity.
- Get model and material of trace entity.
- Get vector and eye angles of local player.
- Get vector and angles of trace entity relative to world.
- Get vector and angles of hit pos relative to trace entity.
- Get class and name of trace entity.
- Get velocity and angular velocity of trace entity.
- Create a boundary and get the upper and lower values of it.
- Find all entities of a specified class on the map.

# Server Commands
- devtools_findent [class name] - Used for the Find Entity tool to enter the name of the entity you want to search for. This is only temporary until I can get a UI made for this tool.
